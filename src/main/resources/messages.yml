# The messages support Minecraft colour codes. However, instead of using the 'ยง' symbol, please use '&' instead.
# i.e. ChatColor.GOLD is "&6" instead of "ยง6".
# Some lines have placeholders (e.g. $pluginPrefix). You can move/remove the placeholders within the message, but mixing placeholders from other messages will not work.
